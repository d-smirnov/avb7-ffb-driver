# logitech-wmff-driver
A driver for the Logitech WingMan Formula Force for Win7+

## Installation

**Warning:** This driver is not digitally signed. For Windows versions which have "driver
signature enforcement" enabled (definitely Windows 10, maybe even Windows 8), you have to
disable that before installing the driver.

For installation, you just have to download a [current repository archive](https://github.com/timschumi/logitech-wmff-driver/archive/master.zip) and
extract it somewhere. Then, go into the device manager, right-click on your device, press
"Update driver", "Search for drivers on my computer" and select the folder you previously
extracted.
